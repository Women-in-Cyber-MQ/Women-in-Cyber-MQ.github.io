<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
  Women in Cybersec was started in 2023 with the aim to get more women inspired
  and passionate about getting into cybersecurity. Since we started we have held
  multiple events with a growing community of incredible women. We have also
  competed in multiple hackathons, placing 3rd in the Women's Category at
  DownUnderCTF 2023.
