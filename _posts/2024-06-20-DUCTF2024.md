## DownUnderCTF is coming this July 5th to July 7th!

Ready to join us at [DownUnderCTF 2024](https://downunderctf.com/)? We are looking for awesome women to team up again for this years competition. Last year we came in 3rd place in the women's category and we'd love to get there again or beat it!

Teams are of up to 5. For more information, please head over to our Discord.

Thank you so much to our awesome sponsor [**Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/centres/centre-for-applied-artificial-intelligence) for sponsoring our participation in DUCTF 2024!
